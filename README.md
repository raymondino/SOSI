# SOSI
This project aims to leverage semantic technologies to detect soccer offside in real time
SOSI stands for "socer offside semantic importance"
> semantic importance is a concept proposed by [Rui Yan et al.](http://events.linkeddata.org/ldow2016/papers/LDOW2016_paper_13.pdf).
It facilitates the problem of data eviction in the stream reasoning context. Semantic importance evaluates the contributions or potential contributions of the streaming data to the query execution. The semantic importance can be embodied as a priority vector, where each element is ranked by preference. The data being processed is then ranked according to their semantic importance priority vector. The data with small semantic importance priority vector will be evicted. 

The original data is in csv format, for more details, please refer to this [paper](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2490000/2488283/p289-mutschler.pdf?ip=128.113.243.82&id=2488283&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=7777116298C9657D%2EAF047EA360787914%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&CFID=617127925&CFTOKEN=68145667&__acm__=1463579274_640ab246f722c5d02658a5f11df48ab3) and their [website](http://www.orgs.ttu.edu/debs2013/index.php?goto=cfchallengedetails).
